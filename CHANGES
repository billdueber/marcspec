0.3.0
  * Changed behavior with respect to repeated subfields. A spec such as '260 ac' returns the values of the 'a' and
  'c' subfields concatenated together. A request for '631 z' would, similarly, return the values *of all the subfield
  z's* concatenated together. I'm now treating this as a special case. If the request is for a single subfield code,
  multiple values are returned separate from each other.
