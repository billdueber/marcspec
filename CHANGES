0.5.0
  * Allow solr field names to repeat in a spec set. This allows you to cumulatively add to a solr field based on "regular" 
    and custom (or, say, two custom) specs.
0.4.0
  * MAJOR BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!! The signature for custom routines is now def function(doc, record, my, args), where
  "doc" is a hashlike (usually a SolrDocument) that contains all the work that has happened up to this point. The idea is that you 
  can use previously-computed values to determine values for different fields. Use sparingly.
0.3.0
  * Changed behavior with respect to repeated subfields. A spec such as '260 ac' returns the values of the 'a' and
  'c' subfields concatenated together. A request for '631 z' would, similarly, return the values *of all the subfield
  z's* concatenated together. I'm now treating this as a special case. If the request is for a single subfield code,
  multiple values are returned separate from each other.
  
0.2.0
  * First public release
